          <p class="lead mb-4 mr-8">We started life in 2009 to help NHS organisations stay relevant in an emerging digital age.  

          <p class="lead mb-4 mr-8">Initially, we used our ‘fast focused innovation process’ with frontline NHS clinicians to create more than 20 prototypes between 2010 and 2015.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-4 mr-8">We then created and licensed Rally Round, an application that enables the family and friends of vulnerable people to create virtual support networks, so loved ones can have more independence at home. </p>

          <p class="lead mb-4 mr-8">Since 2018, we have focused entirely on Recap Health.</p>

          <p class="lead mb-4 mr-8">It’s an easy to use digital patient education platform, developed in close partnership with Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS FT and University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust.</p>
